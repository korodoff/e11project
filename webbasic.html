    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you 
        must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set 
        of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. 
        This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you 
        made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a <i>goal state;</i> if 
        you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good 
        leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or 
        all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, 
        you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get 
        to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <i>backtrack</i> to continue the search 
        for a good leaf by revoking your <i>most recent</i> choice, and trying out the 
        next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice 
        that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the 
        root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model 
        of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure 
        called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices 
        we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is 
        called <i>depth-first tree searching.</i>)</p>
    <p><b><font size="+1"><br>
            The backtracking algorithm.</font></b></p>
    <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node 
            n:</p>
    <p color="red"><b><pre font-family="verdalna"><font color="red">
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n{
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
    </font></pre></b></p>
    <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a <i>boolean</i> function. This is 
        essential to understanding the algorithm. If <code>solve(n)</code> is true, 
        that means node<code> n </code>is part of a solution--that is, node<code> n 
        </code>is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say 
        that<code> n </code>is <i>solvable</i>. If<code> solve(n) </code>is false, then 
        there is <i>no</i> path that includes<code> n</code> to any goal node.</p>
    <p>How does this work?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of<code> n </code>is solvable, then<code> n </code>is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of<code> n </code>is solvable, then<code> n </code>is not solvable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node<code> n </code>is solvable (part 
        of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of<code> 
        n </code>is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of<code> n</code>. 
        In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
      <pre>        for each child c of n {
                  if solve(c) succeeds, return true
              }
              return false</pre>
      <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the 
        leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node, 
        it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by 
        the lines</p>
      <blockquote><pre>if n is a leaf node {
          if the leaf is a goal node, return true
          else return false
      }</pre></blockquote>
      <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it 
        thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>
      <dir> 
        <li>To search a tree: 
          <ol>
            <li> If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node,</li>
            <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal 
              node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </dir>
