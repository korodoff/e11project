            <li class="child ">CSS describe how HTML elements are to be display on screen,paperm,or in other media</li>
            <li class="child "><span class="test">Css is not necessary </span> <span class="test1"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

        <h3 class="heading"> CSS can be added to HTML documents in three ways</h3>
        <ul class="child1 child4">
            <li>inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>internal - ny using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>The most common way ta add CSS. is to keep the styles in external css files. however, <span class="test1"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="child1">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID,on the other hand,applies a style to a unique element.ID is also special in that you acn use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
        <p class="child1">in CSS, selector are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element</p>
        <p class="child1">there is a wide range of selector available/ two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
